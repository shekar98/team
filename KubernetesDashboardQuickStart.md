# Kubernetes Dashboard Quickstart
This document describes how to use the Kubernetes Administration Dashboard.
Kubernetes Dashboard enables the cluster administrator to get overall health of the cluster
and get details of each node, pod and service that is part of the cluster.

### Version
  - Current version of Kubernetes is 1.4.0
  - The admin dashboard version is 1.4.2

### Dashboard Web
The dashboard web interface is accessible through the same port on the IP address of any of
the cluster nodes. To get the hostport, first get the cluster id, by running get clusters
command, followed by get details for the cluster.
```shell
$ cerebro_cli agent <masterip> kubernetes-info
Example:
$ cerebro_cli agent 10.1.10.101 kubernetes-info
```
Note down the dashboardPort value

Using your favorite browser launch the dashboard with URL similar to the following example.

Example:  http://10.1.10.101:31779

### Basic navigation
The navigation panel on the left connects to the 'default' namespace. CDAS services are
launched in this namespace. kube-system namespace will show the Kubernetes system pods
and services.

Kubernetes deploys and schedules containers in groups called pods. A pod typically has one
or more containers that provides a CDAS service.

You may use the dashboard ui to list the various CDAS services and confirm that the desired number of pods is running for each service. Typically, you would run one cerebro-planner-worker pod and several cerebro-worker pods depending on your workload needs.<br />

For example, a 10-node CDAS cluster would have the following pods:<br />
    - 1 canary pod  
    - 1 cerebro-catatog pod  
    - 1 cerebro-catalog-ui pod  
    - 1 zookeeper pod  
    - 1 cerebro-planner-worker pod  
    - 9 cerebro-worker pods  

Let's try a few of sample dashboard operations:<br />
      1. Keeping the namespace as 'default', click on 'Deployments' on the left navigation panel.
      Makes sure that all CDAS services are running. This should include cerebro-catalog,
      cerebro-catalog-ui and cerebro-planner-worker.
      2. Click on 'Pods' on the left navigation panel
      Make sure that the list is similar to the example above, including the desired number
      of pods.
      3. Click on 'Pods'.
      Scroll to the right of the cerebro-planner-worker pod and click on the icon with small
      horizontal bars. This will show the logs in a separate tab/window on your browser.
      The logs are a quick way to detect any issues with the pod.
